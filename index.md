## About

I am a media artist and graphics programmer currently based in Portland, Oregon. I build custom software that explores topics like computational origami, knot theory, geometry, and folding.

I graduated from the Digital Media Design program at the University of Pennsylvania, an interdisciplinary major that blends computer science and art. I also minored in music. I attended the spring 2015 session of The School for Poetic Computation: an artist run school in NYC that explores the intersections of hardware, code, and poetry. Recently, I finished a 3-year stint as an interactive developer at Obscura Digital in San Francisco and now work as an independent contractor and consultant.

In my free time, I study Hindustani classical music (sitar) with [Josh Feinberg](https://www.joshsitar.com/), fold origami, study mathematics and geometry, learn languages (currently learning Japanese), and compose electronic music.

This website showcases a few of my personal projects. I also post (a ton of) experiments and works-in-progress on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/mwalczyk/) account.

**Statement**

> Michael Walczyk is a software artist and designer. Inspired by topological phenomena - folding, knots, maps, 
> deformations - he creates software programs that investigate dimensionality, permutations, connectedness, and 
> memory. He is particularly interested in the tabular, systematic design language of mathematics and how these forms 
> of representation can be codified and/or repurposed. His work, which is increasingly a collaboration between 
> physical materials and digital simulation, embraces the inherent  randomness and error that occur in both 
> virtual and analog domains.
